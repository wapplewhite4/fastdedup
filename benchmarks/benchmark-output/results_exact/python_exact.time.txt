_duckdb.OutOfMemoryException: Out of Memory Error: failed to pin block of size 256.0 KiB (49.0 GiB/49.0 GiB used)

Possible solutions:
* Reducing the number of threads (SET threads=X)
* Disabling insertion-order preservation (SET preserve_insertion_order=false)
* Increasing the memory limit (SET memory_limit='...GB')
